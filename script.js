//OVERVIEW OF THE EXPECTED END PRODUCT
//a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. 
    //the function takes two parameters of playerSelection and computerSelection.
        //playerSelection could be taken from a prompt (case insensitive).
    //then returns a string that declares the winner of the round. 

// scores 
let playerScore = 1;

let computerScore = 1;

// buttons is a node list. It looks and acts much like an array.
const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('button');

// we use the .forEach method to iterate through each button
buttons.forEach((button) => {

    // and for each one we add a 'click' listener
    button.addEventListener('click', () => {
        if (button.id == 1){
            return playerSelection = "rock", console.log("rock");
